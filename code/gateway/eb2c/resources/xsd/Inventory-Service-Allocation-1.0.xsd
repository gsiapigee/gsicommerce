        The allocation operation should be called immediately after the shopping 
        user acts to submit a new order.
        The operation is used to reserve inventory for a customer order.
        This allocation operation is executed separately from order create so 
        that inventory can be reserved to a shopping session while the sometimes
        lengthy process of creating the new order is transacted and a competing 
        shopper session doesn't get the inventory first.  This practice also 
        helps prevent over-selling high velocity items.

        This type defines the syntax of a request message sent to the 
        inventory allocation API.  This request requires:
        <ul>
        <li>A reservation identifier which is used to identify the reservation
        created by this request to the backing order management system.  
        This identifier must be universally unique</li>
        <li>A request identifier which is used by the service to protect
        against duplicate request submissions.  This identifier must be
        universally unique.</li>
        <li>One or more order items</li>
